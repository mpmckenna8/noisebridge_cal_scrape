This is meant to be a simple way to get information on what's going on at
noisebridge and put it into arrays for people to use in their apps.

This uses node.js so get that installed and npm and then run:

npm install

Then you'll have the dependencies necessary to run index.js with:

node index.js

Note both commands should be run in the directory for this project.  Then you'll
get new files in the repeats and singles directories you can use for to let
everyone know what's going on a Noisebridge.
